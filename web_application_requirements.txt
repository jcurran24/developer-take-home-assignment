Summary: The web application you'll be building will provide users the ability to search for colleges and 
view college profile information. A wireframe for each page can be found within the ./wireframe directory. 
The base web application included with this project already contains a base stylesheet, which is imported
into each of the jsp pages, and jquery-2.1.3, which is also imported into each of the jsp pages. To access
the base search page use localhost:8080/search and to access the base college profile page use 
localhost:8080/college. Also, please take note that you can find example database access code within the Main 
method of com.cappex.Main, which is also the method that starts the server.
